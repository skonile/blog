# Siyabonga Konile's blog

This repository is for my blog posts where I will be showing off my skills as a developer and also develop my writing skills in the proccess. In my this blog I will be writing mostly about programming, tech products and some tech related things, maybe every now and then about small off-topic things. I plan to create everything from scratch even this blog website with the help of HUGO. 

I used Figma to design this blog and you can check out the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/9aJMCFNQkgycuZgSS1bcg4/Portfolio-blog?node-id=34%3A414&t=VNlUru67BRVaUm08-1). For the code highlighter I am planning on using the [Prismjs](https://prismjs.com/) code highlighter.

The blog will have one additional section for refrences of the languages and the technologies I have learned and will be learning.
